## Released NFT Control Is Missing
On function `releaseManagedNFT`, at the end there should be control to check if given `nftContract` parameter is found in `ManagedNFTs` array or not. However that control is missing. Even if its not found, event will be emitted.

```solidity
   function releaseManagedNFT(
        address nftContract,
        address to
    ) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        LiquidInfrastructureNFT nft = LiquidInfrastructureNFT(nftContract);
        nft.transferFrom(address(this), to, nft.AccountId());

        // Remove the released NFT from the collection
        for (uint i = 0; i < ManagedNFTs.length; i++) {
            address managed = ManagedNFTs[i];
            if (managed == nftContract) {
                // Delete by copying in the last element and then pop the end
                ManagedNFTs[i] = ManagedNFTs[ManagedNFTs.length - 1];
                ManagedNFTs.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
        // By this point the NFT should have been found and removed from ManagedNFTs
        require(true, "unable to find released NFT in ManagedNFTs");

        emit ReleaseManagedNFT(nftContract, to);
    }
```
