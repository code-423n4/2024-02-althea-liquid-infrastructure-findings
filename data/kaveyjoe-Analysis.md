## Overview & Mechanism Review 


### **1 . LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol**


The LiquidInfrastructureERC20 contract is designed to represent an investment in real-world assets through a tokenized system. It manages a collection of LiquidInfrastructureNFTs, which generate revenue that is distributed to holders of the LiquidInfrastructureERC20 tokens. The contract includes mechanisms for revenue distribution, minting and burning of tokens, and management of NFTs that represent the underlying assets.

#### **Mechanism Review**

 **i. Revenue Distribution**

- The contract collects revenue from ManagedNFTs and distributes it to token holders.
- The distribution is based on the balance of each holder relative to the total supply.
- A locking mechanism (LockedForDistribution) prevents token transfers during distribution.

 **ii . Minting and Burning**

- The owner can mint new tokens, and holders can burn their tokens.
- Minting and burning are restricted during distributions and must comply with the MinDistributionPeriod.

 **iii . NFT Management**

- The contract can add and release LiquidInfrastructureNFTs from its management.
- Withdrawals from managed NFTs are deposited into the contract for future distributions.

 **iv . Holder Management**

- An allowlist (HolderAllowlist) controls who can hold the tokens.
- The contract tracks holders for distribution purposes.


### **2  . LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol**

The LiquidInfrastructureNFT contract is an ERC721 token designed to represent ownership of a Liquid Infrastructure Account within the Althea network. This account is connected to the Cosmos Bank module and is intended to receive periodic revenue. The contract includes mechanisms for setting balance thresholds for various ERC20 tokens, withdrawing balances, and recovering the account in case of loss.

#### **Mechanism Review**

**i . Threshold Management**
-  The contract allows the owner or an approved entity to set balance thresholds for ERC20 tokens using the setThresholds function. These thresholds determine the amount of each token that should remain in the Cosmos Bank account, with excess funds being transferred to the contract.

**ii . Withdrawal Functions**
 - There are two withdrawal functions, withdrawBalances and withdrawBalancesTo, which allow the owner or an approved entity to transfer ERC20 tokens from the contract to a specified address.

**iii . Account Recovery**
-  The recoverAccount function is designed to initiate a recovery process in the event of loss. This process is expected to be handled by the x/microtx module, which will transfer all tokens from the Cosmos Bank account to the contract.

**iv . Event Emission**
-  The contract emits events for significant actions, which are intended to be monitored off-chain and trigger corresponding actions in the Cosmos ecosystem.





### 3 . OwnableApprovableERC721.sol


The  OwnableApprovableERC721 contract extends the functionality of an ERC721 token, which is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This contract is designed to introduce additional access control mechanisms on top of the standard ERC721 functions. It provides two modifiers, onlyOwner and onlyOwnerOrApproved, which restrict the execution of functions to either the owner of a specific token or to an address that has been approved by the owner.

#### **Mechanism Review**

**i . onlyOwner Modifier**

- The onlyOwner modifier uses the ownerOf function from the ERC721 standard to check if the caller (_msgSender()) is the owner of the specified token. If the caller is not the owner, the transaction is reverted with an error message.

**ii . onlyOwnerOrApproved Modifier**

- The onlyOwnerOrApproved modifier uses a private function _isApprovedOrOwner (presumably from the ERC721 contract, although not explicitly shown in the code snippet) to check if the caller is the owner, has been approved for all the owner's tokens via setApprovalForAll, or has been approved to manage the specific token via approve. If none of these conditions are met, the transaction is reverted with an error message.

## Codebase Quality Analysis

**Readability and Conventions**
- Contracts appears to follow Solidity naming conventions and includes comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the contract and its methods, which is good for readability and maintainability.
- The use of NatSpec comments for functions provides clarity on their intended behavior and usage.

**Modularity and Reusability**
- Contracts leverages OpenZeppelin's libraries for standard functionality such as ERC20 token behavior, ownership, and security features, which promotes code reusability and reliability.
- The contracts could benefit from more modular design, especially in the distribution logic, to handle potential scalability issues.
- The use of descriptive variable and function names helps in understanding the contract's logic.


**Maintainability**
- The code is modular with a clear separation of concerns, which should make future updates easier to implement.
- The use of constants for versioning and account ID indicates a thought towards future iterations.
- The event-driven architecture allows for off-chain systems to react to changes, which is good for maintainability.


**Upgradability**
- The contracts does not appear to be upgradable. This could be a significant limitation if bugs are found or if improvements are needed in the future.

**Security Practices**

- The use of ReentrancyGuard is a good security practice to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- The contract restricts critical operations to the owner, which is a double-edged sword; it prevents unauthorized access but also centralizes control.

**Documentation**
- Inline comments provide a good level of documentation for understanding the contract's purpose and functionality.






## Economic Model Analysis

####  1 . LiquidInfrastructureERC20

**Token Supply Management**
- The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens, which could affect the token's value if not managed transparently and judiciously.
Burning mechanisms allow for deflationary pressure on the token supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.

**Revenue Distribution**

- The economic model is based on distributing revenue from managed NFTs to token holders, which incentivizes holding the token to receive a share of the earnings.
- The distribution mechanism needs to ensure fairness and transparency in how revenues are allocated to maintain trust in the economic model.

**Holder Incentives**

- The allowlist system could be used to incentivize certain behaviors or partnerships, but it also introduces centralization and potential bias in holder management.
- The locking of transfers during distributions could discourage active trading of the token, which might impact liquidity and price discovery.

**Risk Management**

- The contract's economic model is tied to the performance of the underlying NFT assets. Diversification of these assets is crucial to mitigate the risk of revenue concentration.
- The minimum distribution period (MinDistributionPeriod) helps manage the frequency of distributions, but the value needs to be carefully chosen to balance between regular income for token holders and operational efficiency.



#### 2 . LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol
**Tokenomics**
- The contract is designed to manage the economic activity of a Liquid Infrastructure Account, which involves receiving and disbursing funds.
- The setting of thresholds for ERC20 tokens is a critical economic mechanism that determines how funds are managed within the ecosystem.

**Incentive Structures**
- The contract does not directly implement incentive structures but is part of a larger ecosystem where incentive structures would be critical for the pay-per-forward network.
- The withdrawal functions ensure that the owner can access the funds, which is an essential incentive for maintaining the infrastructure.

**Risks and Mitigations**
- Centralization risk due to the owner's control over threshold settings and withdrawals. This could be mitigated by introducing decentralized governance.
- Economic risks associated with the reliance on the x/microtx module for cross-chain interactions. Any failure or exploit within this module could impact the contract's economic model.

**Scalability**
- The contract's economic model must be scalable to handle a growing number of microtransactions as the network expands.
- The use of ERC20 tokens and the ability to set thresholds for multiple tokens indicate a design that considers scalability.

**Market Dynamics**
- The contract's functionality will likely be influenced by the broader market dynamics of the ERC20 tokens it manages.
- Fluctuations in token values could impact the thresholds and the frequency of transfers to and from the Cosmos Bank account.





## Risk and Challanges 

- **Regulatory uncertainty:** The regulatory landscape surrounding tokenized real-world assets is still evolving, posing potential challenges for adoption and compliance.
- **Market adoption:** LI requires widespread adoption by infrastructure owners, users, and DeFi participants to achieve success.
- **System complexity:** The interplay between various components and protocols introduces complexity, requiring careful management and monitoring.


## Centralzation Risks



 - Contracts were centralized around the owner role, which has significant control over the contract's critical functions. This centralization poses a risk if the owner's private key is compromised.

- contracts owner has significant control over critical functions, including minting tokens, adding/removing NFTs, and managing the holder allowlist.
- The owner's ability to approve or disapprove holders introduces a central point of control and potential censorship.

- Contracts functionality is heavily reliant on the correct operation of the Althea network and the x/microtx module. Any issues in the Cosmos side could affect the contract's intended behavior.




## Systematic Risks


- The distribute function could fail due to gas limitations if there are too many holders, potentially locking the contract.
- contracts reliance on the owner for several administrative functions creates a single point of failure.
- The lack of an upgrade mechanism means that any discovered vulnerabilities or bugs cannot be fixed without deploying a new contract.
- Economic risks associated with the reliance on the x/microtx module for cross-chain interactions. Any failure or exploit within this module could impact the contract's economic model.
