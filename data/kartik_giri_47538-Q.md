### Constructor Placement in `LiquidInfrastructureERC20` contract.

**Description:** In Solidity, it's a best practice to place the constructor at the top of the contract, immediately after the state variables. This convention enhances readability and clarity, making it easier for developers to quickly locate and understand the initialization logic of the contract.

**Impact:** Placing the constructor at the end of the contract might confuse developers, especially those used to standard Solidity practices. This can make it harder to understand how the contract is set up and initialized, possibly slowing down development and causing more mistakes.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Move the constructor to the top of the contract, immediately after the state variables, to adhere to standard Solidity conventions and improve code clarity and readability.
