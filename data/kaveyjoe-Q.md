###  Bug 1: Missing Validation in `setThresholds` Function of `LiquidInfrastructureNFT`
- **Description**: The `setThresholds` function in `LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol` does not validate the input arrays for zero addresses or zero amounts, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Impact**: Setting a threshold with a zero address or amount could cause logical errors in balance management and distribution.
- **Proof of Concept**:
  - A call to `setThresholds` with a zero address or zero amount in the arrays does not revert or validate against such inputs.
- **Recommendation**: Add input validation in `setThresholds` to check for zero addresses and non-zero amounts.

### Bug 2: Unchecked Return Value in `withdrawBalancesTo`
- **Description**: The function `withdrawBalancesTo` in `LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol` does not check the return value of the ERC20 `transfer` function.
- **Impact**: If the ERC20 token does not return a value or returns false, the function will silently fail without reverting, potentially leading to loss of funds.
- **Proof of Concept**:
  - If an ERC20 token used in `withdrawBalancesTo` is non-compliant and does not return a boolean value, the transfer might fail without reverting the transaction.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that the return value of the `transfer` function is checked and revert the transaction if it returns false.


### Bug 3: Improper Access Control in `approveHolder` and `disapproveHolder`

- **Description**: The functions `approveHolder` and `disapproveHolder` in `LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol` do not check if the caller is the owner of the token, allowing any user to approve or disapprove holders.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized users could manipulate the holder allowlist, potentially disrupting the token distribution process.
- **Proof of Concept**:
  - Any address can call `approveHolder` or `disapproveHolder` without restrictions.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that only the contract owner can call these functions by adding the `onlyOwner` modifier.

### Bug 4:  Incorrect Modifier Logic in OwnableApprovableERC721
   
   - **Detailed Description**: The `onlyOwner` modifier in the OwnableApprovableERC721 contract uses the ERC721 `ownerOf` function directly on the contract instance, which might not behave as expected due to the context in which it's called.
   - **Impact:** This could lead to scenarios where the ownership check does not perform as intended, potentially allowing unauthorized access to certain functions.
   - **Proof of Concept:**
   - Deploy the OwnableApprovableERC721 contract and mint a token to an address.
   - Attempt to call a function protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier from an address that is not the owner.
   - In certain inheritance structures, the direct use of `ERC721(this).ownerOf(tokenId)` might not reference the intended contract instance.
   - **Recommendation:** Replace `ERC721(this).ownerOf(tokenId)` with `ownerOf(tokenId)` to ensure the correct contract context is used for ownership checks.
