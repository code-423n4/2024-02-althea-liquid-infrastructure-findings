Issue: The  [`_afterTokenTransfer`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure/blob/main/liquid-infrastructure/contracts/LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol#L164) function in the LiquidInfrastructureERC20 contract is intended to manage the holders array by removing addresses that no longer hold tokens. There is a concern that this function may not be called as part of the token transfer process, potentially leading to an outdated holders array.

Impact: The impact of this issue is likely low, as it pertains to internal state management rather than the core ERC20 transfer functionality. The primary consequence would be the potential for the holders array to contain addresses that do not accurately reflect the current state of token ownership. This could have minor implications for gas optimization, as the contract may iterate over a larger set of holders than necessary during operations that involve this array.

Severity: Low. The issue does not affect the security or critical operations of the contract but may result in slightly higher gas costs during functions that utilize the holders array.

Recommendation: Review the contract's inheritance structure and ensure that the  [`_afterTokenTransfer`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure/blob/main/liquid-infrastructure/contracts/LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol#L164) function is properly called after token transfers. Additionally, implement tests to verify the correct behavior of this function and consider optimizing the contract's logic to minimize unnecessary storage and iteration over the holders array.
