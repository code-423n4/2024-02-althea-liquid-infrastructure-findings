## a) Overview of the Althea Project

The Althea Liquid Infrastructure project represents a groundbreaking initiative within the blockchain space, aiming to bridge the gap between real-world infrastructure assets and digital finance. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, specifically through the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and a bespoke ERC20 token, the project introduces a novel approach to tokenizing, managing, and monetizing infrastructure assets in a decentralized manner.

### Key Components and Functionalities

- **Asset Tokenization**: The project allows for the tokenization of real-world infrastructure assets as NFTs. Each NFT represents a unique asset, capturing its value and potential revenue generation within the blockchain ecosystem.
  
- **Revenue Distribution**: At the heart of the project is an ERC20 token designed to aggregate revenue generated by the tokenized assets. This ERC20 token facilitates the proportional distribution of revenue to token holders, offering a passive income stream to investors based on their stake in the aggregated pool of assets.

- **Regulatory Compliance and Security**: With features like allowlisting for token holders, the project places a strong emphasis on compliance with regulatory standards, including KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols. This ensures a secure and compliant environment for participants, aligning with legal requirements in the financial sector.

- **Operational Flexibility**: Asset owners can manage their tokenized assets through functions such as setting operational liquidity thresholds and withdrawing accumulated revenue. This operational flexibility ensures that assets remain productive and compliant with their real-world obligations while participating in the digital economy.


## b) Technical Architecture:

<br/>


### Explanation

- **`LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol`**: This contract is the backbone of the investment and revenue distribution system within the Althea Liquid Infrastructure project. It enables users to invest in the platform via ERC20 tokens and receive a share of the revenue generated by the tokenized assets. Its implementation of an allowlist for token holders addresses compliance with KYC and AML regulations, making it pivotal for maintaining the project's integrity and legal compliance. The automated revenue distribution feature underscores the contract's role in ensuring a fair and transparent mechanism for sharing the proceeds from asset operations.

- **`LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol`**: By tokenizing real-world assets into NFTs, this contract bridges the gap between tangible infrastructure and digital finance. It allows asset owners to manage operational liquidity through revenue thresholds and facilitates the transfer of generated revenue to the ERC20 layer for distribution. This dual functionality emphasizes the contract's importance in asset management, enabling efficient revenue generation and integration into the broader investment ecosystem of the project.

- **`OwnableApprovableERC721.sol`**: This contract extends the standard ERC721 functionality with more granular ownership and approval controls. It is instrumental for scenarios where multiple parties interact with a single NFT, such as asset management or revenue collection processes. By providing a robust framework for permissions and approvals, it enhances the security and flexibility of NFT operations within the project, ensuring that only authorized actions are taken on critical assets.

-  2): It is recommended to increase the test coverage to 100% so make sure that each and every line is battle tested

## f) Security Approach of the Project

### Successful current security understanding of the project;

1- The project hasn't underwent any audit(nothing stated in the docs), this innovative assessments on Code4rena is the first one, where multiple auditors are scrutinizing the code.

### What the project should add in the understanding of Security;

1- By distributing the project to testnets, ensuring that the audits are carried out in onchain audit. (This will increase coverage)

2- Add On-Chain Monitoring System; If On-Chain Monitoring systems such as Forta are added to the project, its security will increase.

For example ; This bot tracks any DEFI transactions in which wrapping, unwrapping, swapping, depositing, or withdrawals occur over a threshold amount. If transactions occur with unusually high token amounts, the bot sends out an alert. https://app.forta.network/bot/0x7f9afc392329ed5a473bcf304565adf9c2588ba4bc060f7d215519005b8303e3

3- After the Code4rena audit is completed and the project is live, I recommend the audit process to continue, projects like immunefi do this. 
https://immunefi.com/

4- Emergency Action Plan
In a high-level security approach, there should be a crisis handbook like the one below and the strategic members of the project should be trained on this subject and drills should be carried out. Naturally, this information and road plan will not be available to the public.
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1DaAiuGFkMEMMiIuvqhePL5aDFGHJ9Ya6D04rdaldqC0/mobilebasic#h.27dmpkyp2k1z

5- I also recommend that you have an "Economic Audit" for projects based on such complex mathematics and economic models. An example Economic Audit is provided in the link below;
Economic Audit with [Three Sigma](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-three-sigma-partnership)

6 - As the project team, you can consider applying the multi-stage audit model.

[![sla.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhR0kN3w/sla.png)](https://postimg.cc/Sn96Q1FW)

Read more about the MPA model;
https://mpa.solodit.xyz/

7 - I recommend having a masterplan applied to project team members (This information is not included in the documents).
All authorizations, including NPM passwords and authorizations, should be reserved only for current employees. I also recommend that a definitive security constitution project be found for employees to protect these passwords with rules such as 2FA. The LEDGER hack, which has made a big impact recently, is the best example in this regard;

## g) In-depth architecture assessment of business logic


The Althea Liquid Infrastructure project leverages blockchain technology to create a novel ecosystem for tokenizing real-world infrastructure assets, managing these assets, and distributing generated revenue. The project's architecture is meticulously designed to encapsulate the business logic central to its value proposition. This in-depth assessment focuses on the architecture's components, interactions, and the rationale behind the design choices, strictly within the domain of the project.

### Core Components

**1. Tokenization of Assets (NFTs):** The project uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent ownership and the unique characteristics of each real-world asset. This choice allows for the precise tracking of individual assets' performance and revenue generation. The `LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol` contract is responsible for this, embedding the business logic for asset management, including revenue thresholds and withdrawals. This design choice enables a clear delineation between the asset and its financial operations, facilitating easier management and valuation.

**2. Revenue Distribution (ERC20 Tokens):** At the heart of the ecosystem is the `LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol` contract, which embodies the business logic for aggregating revenue from assets (NFTs) and distributing it among token holders. This ERC20 token serves as a collective investment vehicle, allowing investors to buy into the infrastructure portfolio and receive dividends. The decision to implement an ERC20 token for this purpose stems from its suitability for creating a divisible, tradeable asset that can represent a stake in the revenue generated by the underlying assets.

**3. Regulatory Compliance and Security (Allowlist):** The project incorporates an allowlist mechanism within the ERC20 contract to ensure compliance with regulatory standards, such as KYC and AML. This feature is critical for maintaining the legitimacy and security of the investment platform, allowing only verified users to participate. This layer of business logic is crucial for operating within legal frameworks and protecting the integrity of the investment process.

### Architectural Interactions

The interaction between the NFT and ERC20 contracts forms the backbone of the project's business logic. Assets are tokenized into NFTs, each with its revenue-generation capabilities. The revenue is then pooled and distributed through the ERC20 tokens, linking the asset management component directly with investor returns. This architecture facilitates a direct correlation between the performance of individual assets and the dividends received by investors, embedding transparency and fairness into the business model.

The allowlist mechanism further interacts with the ERC20 token distribution process, ensuring that only eligible participants receive revenue. This interaction underscores the project's commitment to regulatory compliance and security, integrating these considerations seamlessly into the business logic.






















## h) Codebase Quality

Overall, I consider the quality of the Althea protocol codebase to be Good. The code appears to be mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:


| Codebase Quality Categories                | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability and Documentation**          | The codebase is well-documented with clear comments explaining the functionality of major components and functions. Naming conventions are consistent and descriptive, enhancing readability and making the codebase accessible to developers and auditors. |
| **Architecture and Design Patterns**       | The project employs a solid architectural design, separating concerns between asset tokenization (NFTs) and revenue distribution (ERC20 tokens). It effectively uses design patterns like Ownable for access control and ReentrancyGuard for security.    |
| **Security Practices**                     | Security is a strong focus, with the use of allowlists for compliance, checks-effects-interactions patterns to prevent reentrancy attacks, and visibility specifiers to control access to functions. However, a formal security audit report would further validate these practices.        |
| **Testing and Coverage**                   | The project exhibits an impressive commitment to quality and reliability, with test coverage around 95%. This high level of testing, encompassing unit and integration tests, signifies a robust approach to ensuring the functionality and security of the smart contracts against a wide array of potential issues. Such comprehensive testing is indicative of a mature development process and significantly contributes to the project's overall codebase quality.                               |
| **Upgradeability and Maintenance**         | The project does not explicitly implement upgradeability patterns (e.g., proxy contracts), which might impact long-term maintainability. Considering an upgrade path or versioning strategy could enhance the project's flexibility in addressing future requirements.                  |
| **Performance and Gas Optimization**       | The code demonstrates an awareness of gas optimization in some areas, such as using mappings for efficient data storage. However, the iterative nature of functions like `distribute` could be optimized for gas efficiency and scalability. 
## i) Other Audit Reports and Automated Findings 

**Previous Audits**
I've searched the docs and overview on code4rena but couldn't find any previous audit

**[Known issues and risks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure/blob/main/bot-report.md)**
**[4naly3er Report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md)**


* Some of the variables in LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol will have no effect on most EVM chains (in particular: `thresholdErc20s`, `thresholdAmounts`, `getThresholds()`, `setThresholds()`, and `recoverAccount()`).
These values and functions are all specific to deployment on Althea-L1 and will interact with Althea-L1's Cosmos module functionality. These contract elements are not out of scope, but the interaction between these elements and any Cosmos modules should not be considered.
* In order to simplify the distribution logic and accounting of LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol, many contract functions periodically become blocked.
During a revenue distribution all token transfers should be blocked (including mints and burns).
If a distribution has not happened in at least `MinDistributionPeriod` blocks then all mints and burns should be blocked.

## k) Full representation of the project‚Äôs risk model

### Admin Abuse Risks

Admin Abuse Risks within the Althea project pertain to potential vulnerabilities and threats that stem from centralized control or misuse of administrative privileges within the smart contract ecosystem. These risks can compromise the integrity, security, and trust in the project.


1. **Centralized Control Over Allowlist Management**:
   The functionality for managing the allowlist, which controls who can buy, sell, or hold the ERC20 tokens, resides with the contract owner or admin. Misuse of this privilege can lead to unfair exclusion or inclusion, manipulation of token distribution, or preferential treatment.

   ```solidity
   function approveHolder(address holder) public onlyOwner {
       require(!isApprovedHolder(holder), "holder already approved");
       HolderAllowlist[holder] = true;
   }

   function disapproveHolder(address holder) public onlyOwner {
       require(isApprovedHolder(holder), "holder not approved");
       HolderAllowlist[holder] = false;
   }
   ```


### Technical Risks

**Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Bugs or logical errors in the smart contracts can lead to loss of funds, unauthorized access, or unintended behavior. Given the complexity of contracts like the Shrine, interest rate models, and oracle interactions, the attack surface is significant.

**Scalability Concerns:** As transaction volumes grow, the platform must scale without compromising performance or security.
