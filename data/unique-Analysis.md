## System Overview

The system comprises three Solidity smart contracts: `LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol`, `LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol`, and `OwnableApprovableERC721.sol`. These contracts are designed to work together to facilitate investment in real-world assets represented by NFTs and earn rewards in ERC20 tokens.

## Approach Taken-in Evaluating

- Read the ReadME.md.
- Try to understand how the system works by looking at theÂ [<ins>Liquid Infrastructure</ins>](https://www.althea.net/liquid-infrastructure)
- Look at each code individually and focus on the internal function calls.
- Read the test files to get a better idea of the end-to-end scenarios.

## Architecture Description

The architecture consists of three main contracts: `LiquidInfrastructureERC20`, `LiquidInfrastructureNFT`, and `OwnableApprovableERC721`.

- `LiquidInfrastructureERC20` allows users to invest in real-world assets represented by `LiquidInfrastructureNFTs` and earn revenue from the network represented by the token.
- `LiquidInfrastructureNFT` controls a Liquid Infrastructure Account, managing thresholds for controlling balances, ERC20 withdrawals, and account recovery.
- `OwnableApprovableERC721` provides access control modifiers based on token ownership or approval status within an ERC721 contract.

These contracts interact to facilitate the investment process, manage NFT ownership and permissions, and ensure secure access control.

## Some potential areas for improvement and Architecture feedback

1.  **Clarity and Simplification**: The contracts could benefit from improved code readability and simplification to enhance maintainability and ease of understanding for developers.
    
2.  **Security Considerations**: Further security audits and testing may be necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the robustness of the system against attacks.
    
3.  **Gas Optimization**: Optimization of gas usage in smart contracts can help reduce transaction costs and improve overall efficiency, especially in high-demand environments.
    

## Codebase Quality

The codebase demonstrates a solid understanding of Solidity and smart contract development practices. It follows best practices such as access control, event emission, and proper documentation. However, there may be opportunities for refactoring and optimizing certain code segments.

## Systemic & Centralization Risks

The system's reliance on centralized components such as contract owners and approved parties for access control introduces potential centralization risks. Mitigation strategies such as decentralized governance mechanisms could be explored to distribute decision-making authority and reduce dependency on centralized entities.

## Conclusion

Overall, the system presents a promising framework for investment in real-world assets through NFTs and ERC20 token rewards. While the contracts demonstrate functionality and adherence to best practices, there are areas for improvement in terms of codebase quality, security considerations, and decentralization. With continued development and refinement, the system has the potential to provide a robust and efficient platform for users to participate in asset investment and earn rewards.
