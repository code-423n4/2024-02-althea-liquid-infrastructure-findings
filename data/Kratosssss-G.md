ISSUE : In LiquidInfrastructureERC20

1. High Gas Usage in Loop:
        The primary concern is the gas consumption within the loop of the "distribute" function, especially when iterating over a large number of holders.

2. Potential Gas Limit Exceedance:
        The gas-intensive loop may lead to exceeding the Ethereum gas limit, resulting in failed transactions or incomplete distributions.



ANALYSIS :

1.Nested Loop Iterating Over Holders:
        The function uses a nested loop to iterate over holders and distributable ERC20 tokens. Nested loops, especially in the context of token transfers, can be gas-expensive.

2. Repetitive Storage Reads and Writes:
        Storage reads and writes within the loop, such as accessing distributableERC20s.length and holders.length, can contribute to increased gas costs. Minimizing these operations is crucial for optimization.

PROPOSED GAS OPTIMIZATION : 

1.Batch Processing:
        Introduce batch processing to distribute tokens to a limited number of holders in each transaction. This helps avoid gas limit issues by processing distributions in smaller, more manageable batches.

2.Pre-compute Entitlements:
        Calculate entitlements for each holder outside the loop to eliminate redundant calculations within the loop. This reduces gas costs associated with repetitive computations.

3. Use Storage Variables Sparingly:
        Minimize storage reads and writes within the loop to further reduce gas consumption. Storing frequently used values in variables outside the loop can help optimize gas efficiency.


SUGGESTED CODE BELOW : 

function distribute(uint256 numDistributions, uint256 batchSize) public nonReentrant {
    // ...

    uint256 limit = nextDistributionRecipient + numDistributions;
    limit = Math.min(limit, holders.length);

    for (uint256 i = nextDistributionRecipient; i < limit; i += batchSize) {
        uint256 batchLimit = Math.min(i + batchSize, limit);

        for (uint256 j = i; j < batchLimit; j++) {
            address recipient = holders[j];

            if (isApprovedHolder(recipient)) {
                // Calculate entitlements outside the loop
                uint256[] memory entitlements = new uint256[](distributableERC20s.length);

                for (uint256 k = 0; k < distributableERC20s.length; k++) {
                    IERC20 toDistribute = IERC20(distributableERC20s[k]);
                    entitlements[k] = erc20EntitlementPerUnit[k] * toDistribute.balanceOf(recipient);
                }

                // Process entitlements and emit Distribution event
                // ...

                nextDistributionRecipient++;
            }
        }
    }

    // ... (Existing code)
}
