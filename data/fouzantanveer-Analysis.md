The Althea Liquid Infrastructure project presents an innovative approach to tokenizing real-world infrastructure assets, enabling investment and automated revenue distribution through blockchain technology. This initiative bridges the gap between traditional asset management and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance, offering a unique blend of real-world utility and blockchain efficiency.

### Introduction to Althea Liquid Infrastructure

At its core, the Althea Liquid Infrastructure project utilizes blockchain to create a digital representation of physical infrastructure assets, such as internet service infrastructure, renewable energy installations, or any asset capable of generating revenue through operational activities. These assets are tokenized as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the ecosystem, with each NFT corresponding to a specific asset. The project operates on the Althea-L1 blockchain, a Cosmos SDK chain with an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer, facilitating broad interoperability and smart contract capabilities.

### Features of the Project

A key feature of the Althea Liquid Infrastructure project is its dual-token architecture, comprising `LiquidInfrastructureERC20` tokens and `LiquidInfrastructureNFTs`. The ERC20 tokens serve as a vehicle for investment and revenue distribution, allowing holders to earn a share of the revenue generated by the underlying assets. The NFTs represent the individual infrastructure assets, capturing their unique characteristics and revenue-generating potential. This setup provides a transparent, efficient, and secure framework for managing and investing in infrastructure projects.

Another significant aspect is the project's emphasis on regulatory compliance and security. It implements an allowlist mechanism for ERC20 token holders, ensuring that only verified participants can hold tokens and receive distributions. This compliance is critical for adhering to Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations and safeguarding the ecosystem against misuse.

The project also features a sophisticated revenue distribution mechanism. Revenue generated by the infrastructure assets (represented by the NFTs) is aggregated and periodically distributed to the ERC20 token holders. This process is automated through smart contracts, ensuring timely and proportional distribution based on the holders' token balances.

### User Interaction with the Project

From a user perspective, engaging with the Althea Liquid Infrastructure project involves several key interactions, each facilitated by the project's smart contract architecture:

1. **Investment in ERC20 Tokens**: Users can invest in the project by acquiring `LiquidInfrastructureERC20` tokens. These tokens represent a stake in the pool of revenue-generating assets. The investment process would typically involve purchasing these tokens through an initial offering or secondary market transactions, subject to the allowlist restrictions.

2. **Asset Tokenization**: Asset owners looking to tokenize their infrastructure assets into NFTs would interact with the `LiquidInfrastructureNFT` contract. This involves creating a new NFT for each asset, with the contract recording its unique characteristics and linking it to revenue streams.

3. **Revenue Generation and Collection**: The operational activities of the tokenized assets generate revenue, which is then collected into the NFT contract. Asset owners can set thresholds for revenue collection and initiate withdrawals to the `LiquidInfrastructureERC20` contract for distribution.

4. **Revenue Distribution**: ERC20 token holders benefit from automated revenue distributions. The distribution logic considers the total revenue collected from the NFTs and the proportionate share of each ERC20 token holder, ensuring an equitable distribution based on token ownership.

5. **Asset Management and Recovery**: Asset owners have the capability to manage their NFTs, adjusting operational parameters as necessary. The platform also provides mechanisms for asset recovery, safeguarding against loss or theft.
