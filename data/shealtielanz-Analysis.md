- Description Overveiw of the protocol.
- Full Representation of the projects risk model.
    * Admin Abuse Risks.(owner type findings.).         
    * Systematic Risks(contracts issues).
    * Integration Risks(if the bridge is broken).
    * Non-Token Standard.
- Software Engineering Considerations.
rewrite functions in an efficient manner,
modifiers,redundant functions, gas efficiency, use foundry for testing, more audits, version of openzeppelin isn't recent, no determined/specific invariants
- Indept architecture assessment of business logic.
user flows and functionalities of the protocol.
- test suites.
coverage of the testing suites and advices on areas to tests.
- Weakspots and single points of failure.

software engineering,
graph charts.
attacker mindset, when i was attacking the system these are the areas i was thinking about. rounding
Admin privilges
