# Description Overview of the protocol.

Althea Liquid Infrastructure, Is a protocol conceived of a modular concept, drawing from a portable implementation of a revenue-generating NFT and then an ERC20 that can hold one or more of these revenue-generating NFTs. Where each NFT represents an asset or service in the real world, that generates on-chain/tokenized revenue to the NFTs, where a LiquidInfrastructurERC20, manages groups of this NFT, and when the revenue is generated it is distributed fairly amongst the holders of the LiquidInfrastructurERC20 token.
The protocol is unique in the sense that it creates a strong use case for crypto as it grows on real-world ideas and solves problems that people face daily tapping from the services people will use in their day-to-day lives.  
Here when users own the token they facilitate those services provided by Althea L1 Infrastructure and in turn they gain from the revenue generated from the services provided.

# Full Representation of the Project's risk model.
The protocol, contains every normal risk decentralized protocols contains, and the is the enigma of centralization, admin-associated risks, and normal blockchain/solidity issues. some of the following will be detailed below.
## Admin Abuse Risks. (Centralization/Owner type findings.).      
The owner/manager of the LiquidInfrastructureERC20 token, have the ability to.
- Approve Holders.
- Disapprove holders.
In a scenario of misconduct the owner can wreck the holders.
> [!TIP] 
> Make use of a multi-sig wallet to avoid extreme scenarios like this.
This owner is in charge of polling the revenue generated by the NFTs to the LiquidInfrastructureERC20 token, this can be bad as they control the entire distribution system.
## Systematic Risks(Contracts issues).
Smart contract/Blockchain-related issues can be seen as loops with multiple transfers used during distribution and this could DOS the distribution system when past the block gas limit, though this was fairly handled I recommend a cap o the amount to be distributed, another issue is since smart contracts are immutable on-chain before deployment i recommend multiple audits and audits on the fixes made on previous audits.
## Integration Risks(Holders, Upgrades, Tokens).
Integration-related issues concern mainly the deployment of the modular contracts on the Althea L1 blockchain, since much isn't known about the chain this isn't much I can say on the one, but issues affecting the nature of the blockchain could deeply affect the LiquidInfrastructure modular contracts.
## Non-Token Standard.
Concerning token standards, the `entitlements` to be distributed to the different holders are calculated using the contract and the distributable token's balance, tokens with weird decimals should be considered in scenarios like this, since must be made to the holders before the end of a distribution, tokens with weird transfer logic should also be considered during integration with other tokens.
