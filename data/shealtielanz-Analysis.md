# Description Overview of the protocol.

Althea Liquid Infrastructure, Is a protocol conceived of a modular concept, drawing from a portable implementation of a revenue-generating NFT and then an ERC20 that can hold one or more of these revenue-generating NFTs. Where each NFT represents an asset or service in the real world, that generates on chain/tokenized revenue to the NFTs, where a LiquidInfrastructurERC20, manages groups of this NFT and when the revenue is generated it is distributed fairly amongst the holders of the LiquidInfrastructurERC20 token.
The protocol is unique in the sense that it create a strong use case for crypto as it grows on real world ideas and solve problems that people face daily tapping from the services people will use in their day to day life.  
Here when users are in possesion of the token the facilitate those services provided by Althea L1 Infrastructure and in turn the gain from the revenue generated from the service provided.

# Full Representation of the Project's risk model.
The protocol, contains every normal risk decentralized protocols contain, and the is the enigma of centralization, admin associated risks and normal blockchain/solidity issues. some of the following will be detailed below.
## Admin Abuse Risks. (Centralization/Owner type findings.).         
## Systematic Risks(Contracts issues).
## Integration Risks(Holders, Upgrades, Tokens).
## Non-Token Standard.
