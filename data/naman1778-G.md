## [G-01] Using XOR (^) and AND (&) bitwise equivalents

Given 4 variables a, b, c and d represented as such:

    0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 <- a
    0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 <- b
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <- c
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 <- d

To have a == b means that every 0 and 1 match on both variables. Meaning that a XOR (operator ^) would evaluate to 0 ((a ^ b) == 0), as it excludes by definition any equalities.Now, if a != b, this means that thereâ€™s at least somewhere a 1 and a 0 not matching between a and b, making (a ^ b) != 0.Both formulas are logically equivalent and using the XOR bitwise operator costs actually the same amount of gas.However, it is much cheaper to use the bitwise OR operator (|) than comparing the truthy or falsy values.These are logically equivalent too, as the OR bitwise operator (|) would result in a 1 somewhere if any value is not 0 between the XOR (^) statements, meaning if any XOR (^) statement verifies that its arguments are different.
