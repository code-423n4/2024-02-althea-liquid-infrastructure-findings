## It Is Unnecessary To Add Boolean Literal To Condition

In Solidity, the use of boolean literals in conditions, such as in `require` statements or conditional checks, can sometimes be redundant and misleading. A specific example of this practice is using `require(true, "message");`, where the condition always evaluates to true, making the statement's execution unconditional. This not only wastes gas but can also confuse the intent of the code, as it suggests a condition is being checked when it is not. Similarly, using `if (false) { ... }` or other unnecessary boolean literals in conditions can lead to code that is harder to read and understand.

```solidity
require(true, "unable to find released NFT in ManagedNFTs");
```

## Recommendation
Require statement can be removed.
