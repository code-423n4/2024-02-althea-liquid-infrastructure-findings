## It Is Unnecessary To Add Boolean Literal To Condition

In Solidity, the use of boolean literals in conditions, such as in `require` statements or conditional checks, can sometimes be redundant and misleading. A specific example of this practice is using `require(true, "message");`, where the condition always evaluates to true, making the statement's execution unconditional. This not only wastes gas but can also confuse the intent of the code, as it suggests a condition is being checked when it is not. Similarly, using `if (false) { ... }` or other unnecessary boolean literals in conditions can lead to code that is harder to read and understand.

```solidity
require(true, "unable to find released NFT in ManagedNFTs");
```

## Recommendation
Require statement can be removed.


## Unnecessary Assignment
The identified issue involves an unnecessary step of assigning a condition's result to a boolean variable before using it in an if-statement. This extra variable assignment is not required as the condition can be directly evaluated within the if-statement itself, making the code more concise and efficient.


```solidity
        bool stillHolding = (this.balanceOf(from) != 0);
        if (!stillHolding) {
```
```solidity
        bool exists = (this.balanceOf(to) != 0);
        if (!exists) {
```

## Recommendation
Use expression in the if statement condition directly.
