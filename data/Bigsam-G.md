 function _beforeTokenTransfer and  function _afterTokenTransfer are not used within the contract and they hold some crucial function to allow the addition of address into the holders array and removal from the holders array.


function _beforeTokenTransfer()  and  function approveHolder can be incorporated into the mint and distribute function thereby calling it achieves the same thing it would achieve if all those functions were called individually but saving more gas while function _afterTokenTransfer() and function disapproveHolder can be incorporated into the burn and distribute function also.

When we mint a token we assume that someone is purchasing/wants to buy/hold the token, the users account will then undergo approval if not already approved and will be added to the holders array, but we can call all this function together  internally all inside the mint and distribute function. 
Therefore we will succeed in minting, approving and enlisting an account by calling just one function.
The same thing goes for the burn and distribute function we expect that someone is selling, thus we burn, disapprove holder and remove from holders array all at once.
To control Total supply the mint function and burn function can be called individual thus the above incorporation will not affect other purposes of minting and burning.
