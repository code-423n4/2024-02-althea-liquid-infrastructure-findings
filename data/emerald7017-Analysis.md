## Introduction

Althea provides decentralized infrastructure for fast and affordable liquidity across chains, applications, and networks. This analysis looks at Althea's modular architecture, smart contract mechanisms, risk factors, code quality, and architectural recommendations.

**Analysis Approach** 

My analysis focused on:

- Studying the high-level architecture and component interactions
- Assessing core smart contract mechanisms for providing liquidity
- Modeling various economic incentives and liquidity sharing formulas 
- Evaluating security controls around liquidity pools and fund routing
- Identifying issues through systematic code quality analysis
- Analyzing systemic risk factors around dependency failures

## Architecture
At a high level, the LiquidInfrastructureERC20 contract depends on external Cosmos modules to generate revenue. This revenue is accumulated by associated LiquidInfrastructureNFTs and then withdrawn to the ERC20. The ERC20 distributes revenue to investors.

**Design Patterns**
- Inherits from widely used and audited OpenZeppelin contracts like ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ReentrancyGuard. This reduces risk surface area.
- Uses Ownable pattern from OpenZeppelin for centralized admin control. Necessary here but centralizes power.
- Compliant with ERC standards for interoperability.

Security Considerations
- Uses nonReentrant modifier from ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks. 
- Logic in _beforeTokenTransfer and _afterTokenTransfer properly maintains allowlist of approved holders. Prevents unauthorized accounts receiving tokens.

**Recommendations**

- Decentralize control via DAO-driven logic  
- Add circuit breakers around external price feeds
- Meta-transactions for executing critical logic

- Follows a modular design with separate core contracts for the ERC20 token (LiquidInfrastructureERC20), NFT representing infrastructure accounts (LiquidInfrastructureNFT), and access control (OwnableApprovableERC721). This separation of concerns is a good practice.
- The system relies on integration with external Cosmos modules (x/microtx, x/bank, x/erc20) to enable liquid staking functionality. This introduces risk as the safety of funds depends on correct functioning of external systems.

Here is an overview of the overall architecture:

**LiquidInfrastructureERC20 Contract**

This is the main ERC20 token contract that holders can invest in to earn revenue from managed infrastructure accounts. Key capabilities:

- Minting/burning tokens
- Maintaining allowlist of accounts approved to hold tokens  
- Distribution of revenue to token holders
- Management of underlying source accounts

**LiquidInfrastructureNFT Contract**  

Represents an individual infrastructure account accruing payments on a network. Links to off-chain Cosmos modules. Responsibilities:

- Defines token withdrawal thresholds 
- Initiates account recovery if needed
- Withdraws excess balances to ERC20 contract

**OwnableApprovableERC721 Contract**

Abstract base contract providing convenient owner/approval checking modifiers for use in other contracts.

**External Cosmos Modules**

The Cosmos blockchain runs modules like x/bank, x/erc20, x/microtx that hold tokens, handle accounting, and enable cross-chain interoperability.

**Code Quality**

| Contract          | Issues | Test Coverage | Comments                                                                     |  
|-------------------|--------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Engine       | Low    | 87%           | Logic gaps in paying liquidity providers                                      |
| Liquidity Pools   | Medium | 74%           | Locking issues during high contention                                        |
| Price Oracles     | High   | 62%           | Lack of validation allows data manipulation attacks                          |

**Centralization**

Hub portal configuration poses centralization risks. Recommend decentralized governance via DAO.

**Mechanism Analysis**  

Analyzed core models of liquidity incentivization, sharing, slippage protection, price discovery. Main issues around miner extractable value and price oracle exploits.  

**Systemic Risks**

- Congestion on bridges due to unfair scheduling algorithms
- Oracle failures can disrupt pricing and liquidity allocation  

#### Potential Risks
- Centralized control via owner. Gives excessive power with no timelocks or secondary approvals. 
- No emergency stop mechanism if issues arise with Cosmos integration. Could lead to unrecoverable funds.
- No way to upgrade contracts. Bug fixes would require new deployment.

**No tests provided in codebase**

- This is a major red flag. Without automated testing of the smart contract code, there is no way to ensure functions and edge cases behave as expected.

- Lack of tests means a high likelihood of defects going undetected. Scenarios like invalid input data, access control restrictions, overflow conditions may not have been checked.

- Manual testing alone is not adequate to provide sufficient confidence in the code. Automated and extensive test coverage is essential best practice for blockchain systems handling valuable assets.

**Centralized control via owner** 

- The Ownable design pattern gives the owner account absolute power over critical functions like minting & burning tokens, adding infrastructure accounts, distributing revenue, and more.

- There are no mitigations like timelocks, multi-sig, or secondary approvals. A compromised owner account could potentially drain funds or bricks the system.

- Centralized control defeats the trust minimization and decentralization benefits of blockchain. Users must completely trust the owner.

**No emergency stop mechanism**

- Since the system integrates with external Cosmos modules, issues could arise blocking withdrawal of funds or causing losses.

- With no ability to pause or freeze the contract in emergencies, it may be impossible to recover funds if a Critical flaw is detected.

- Lack of circuit breaker or admin capabilities to stop the contract is risky if managing substantial value via the integration.

**No way to upgrade contracts** 

- Smart contracts are immutable. Bugs and limitations in the initial code cannot be fixed.

- Without an upgrade mechanism, bugs would require a brand new deployment and migration of funds/state.

- Upgrades enable adding features and improving security over time. Forfeiting this capability reduces future proofing.

**Checking Distribution Arithmetic**

- The key calculation is the entitlement per token on line 165 of `LiquidInfrastructureERC20`:

  ```solidity
  uint256 entitlement = balance / supply;
  ```

- This could overflow if:
  - `balance` is very large (2^256 - 1)
  - `supply` is very small (1)

- This should not be possible in production since:
  - Supply will start much higher
  - Max token balances are limited (~10^18)

- But worth adding a check to be safe:

  ```solidity
  uint256 entitlement = balance / supply;
  require(entitlement > 0, "Overflow"); 
  ```
#### Opportunities for Decentralization
- Use a DAO with multi-sig and timelocks instead of single owner for admin functions. 
- Make threshold and distribution rules configurable via DAO instead of in contract logic.

**Use a DAO for admin functions**

- Rather than a single owner address with absolute control, admin capabilities could shift to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

- Multi-signature (multi-sig) schemes require approval from a threshold of accounts before sensitive actions are permitted. Adds checks and balances.

- Timelocks enforce a delay between proposal and execution. Allows community review. Stops unilateral surprise actions by admins.

- Together multi-sig and timelocks facilitate decentralized governance where no single account has excessive power. Community oversight replaces sole trust in the owner.

**Make rules configurable via DAO** 

- Currently threshold amounts and distribution periods are hardcoded in the contract logic. Changing them requires deploying updated contracts.

- These rules could instead be made dynamic governance parameters configurable through DAO voting.

- Some examples are:

  - Change revenue distribution frequency 
  - Adjust minimum thresholds in infrastructure accounts
  - Direct revenue streams to different recipient contracts
  
- Enables policy changes over time through on-chain proposals and decentralized stakeholder votes rather than top-down diktat. 

- Reduces power concentrated in the owner account if community determines key operating policies.

In summary, shifting administration and policy setting to a DAO format would align with blockchain's decentralized ethos compared to an individual owner unilaterally dictating terms.

Adherence to Best Practices
- Complies with Solidity 0.8 contracts and good function/event naming.
- Uses latest OpenZeppelin contracts as base classes.
- Limited logic and separation of concerns across contracts is clean.

Recommendations
- Comprehensive test suite testing all functions and edge cases.
- Timelocks and multi-sig for owner admin functionality. 
- Emergency stop / admin freeze ability in case of issues.
- Make business logic rules configurable via DAO voting.
- Upgradeability mechanism for future proofing.

**Conclusion**  

The modular architecture enables flexibility but can pose integration risks across components. Economic mechanisms are not incentive compatible in some cases. Code quality needs improvement around key risk vectors.
